proc(5) - proc  jest  pseudosystemem plików przechowujacy informacje o procesach, który służy jako lepszy interfejs do struktur jądra. Zazwyczaj jest montowany w katalogu /proc.  Jest  on  w większości   przeznaczony   tylko   do  odczytu,  lecz  niektóre  pliki umożliwiają modyfikacje zmiennych jądr

    Contains a hierarchy of special files which represent the current state of the kernel — allowing applications and users to peer into the kernel's view of the system. 
    information detailing the system hardware and any processes currently running.
    
    /proc/ directory contains another type of file called a virtual file. It is for this reason that /proc/ is often referred to as a virtual file system. 
    Most of them are listed as zero bytes in size. In addition, most of the time and date settings on virtual files reflect the current time and date(constantly updated).
    
    /proc/interrupts, /proc/meminfo provide an up-to-the-moment glimpse of the system's hardware. /proc/filesystems file and the /proc/sys/ directory provide system configuration information and interfaces.
    Files containing  similar information topic are grouped into virtual directories and sub-directories.

                ls -al
    
/proc/[pid]/environ
              This file contains the initial environment that was set when
              the currently executing program was started via execve(2).
              The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'), and there may
              be a null byte at the end.

                cat environ | tr '\000' '\n'

/proc/[pid]/cmdline
              This read-only file holds the complete command line for the
              process, unless the process is a zombie.  In the latter case,
              there is nothing in this file: that is, a read on this file
              will return 0 characters.  The command-line arguments appear
              in this file as a set of strings separated by null bytes
              ('\0'), with a further null byte after the last string.

                cat cmdline            

/proc/[pid]/stats
              Status information about the process.  This is used by ps(1).
              It is defined in the kernel source file fs/proc/array.c.

                 cat stat | tr ' ' '\n'            


*3 State: Current state of the process.  One of "R (running)", "S (sleeping)", "D (disk sleep)", "T (stopped)", "T (tracing stop)", "Z (zombie)", or "X (dead)".

*11 Groups: Supplementary group list./Wszystkie grupy uzytkownikow do ktorych ten uzytkownik nalezy

*16 VmPeak: Peak virtual memory size. (Peak memory is the maximum amount of memory your process has used over its lifetime _/ najwyzsza liczba ile uzywalismy adresow pamieci/ najwieksze zuzycie przestrzenii adresowej

*17 VmSize: Virtual memory size.(przestrzeni adresowej)

*21 VmRSS: Resident set size.  Note that the value here is the sum of RssAnon, RssFile, and RssShmem.
              * RssAnon: Size of resident anonymous memory.  (since Linux
                4.5).

              * RssFile: Size of resident file mappings.  (since Linux 4.5).

              * RssShmem: Size of resident shared memory (includes System V
                shared memory, mappings from tmpfs(5), and shared anonymous
                mappings).  (since Linux 4.5).
    RSS is the Resident Set Size and is used to show how much memory is allocated to that process and is in RAM.
    It does not include memory that is swapped out. It does include memory from shared libraries as long as the 
    pages from those libraries are actually in memory. It does include all stack and heap memory.

*32 Threads: Number of threads in process containing this thread.

*46,47 voluntary_ctxt_switches, nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches: Number
                of voluntary and involuntary context switches (since Linux
                2.6.23).
    A voluntary context switch occurs whenever a thread must await the availability of a resource or the arrival of an event. Wywolywane poprzez SYSCALLe

    An involuntary context switch takes place when a thread executes for the duration of its time slice or when the system identifies a higher-priority thread to run. Wywlaszczone przez scheduler.
